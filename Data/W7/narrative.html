  <!-- INTRO / HOOK -->
  <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week, the GenAi Chosen portfolio rebounded sharply</strong>, surging +7.08% and pushing total returns back into positive territory at +3.86% since inception. Over the same Nov 20 – Nov 28 window, the S&P 500 gained +2.57% while Bitcoin advanced +4.36%, though crypto remains deep in drawdown at -25.86% since the starting reference point. The AI-managed portfolio’s strong rotation into cyclical, storage, and defensive names powered a decisive recovery.

  <!-- PORTFOLIO PROGRESS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Portfolio Progress Nov 20 – Nov 28, 2025</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio is a $10,000 aggressive equity strategy</strong> built and managed by a <strong>transformer-based AI model</strong> that prioritizes momentum, conviction, and high-upside setups. The model’s design accepts elevated volatility in pursuit of outperformance over the S&P 500 through concentrated equity exposure.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The goal is simple:</strong> Identify 10 stocks with strong momentum and risk-adjusted upside and hold them through medium-term cycles while keeping sector concentration and position sizing within strict guardrails. This week’s surge represents a decisive reversal from the prior drawdown, as leadership rotated back toward storage, energy, and gold-related names.

  <!-- WEEKLY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Storage Strength, Gold Momentum, Travel Stabilizes</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Data storage stocks delivered the strongest upside</strong>, with Western Digital (+12.47%) and Seagate (+13.18%) powering the week’s recovery. Both continued to benefit from AI hardware demand and improving sentiment in the memory and storage cycle, reinforcing the portfolio’s overweight position in this theme.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Newmont surged +10.4%</strong> as gold prices strengthened amid renewed macro uncertainty and lower real yields. The AI model’s allocation to gold miners proved timely, helping to offset prior softness while improving total-return contribution.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Defensive and industrial names posted stable gains</strong>, including CVS (+5.01%), NRG (+4.91%), GE Vernova (+5.67%), and GE (+2.06%). These positions provided balanced exposure that helped smooth volatility coming off the previous week’s downturn.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Palantir rebounded with a +6.56% weekly move</strong>, regaining momentum after a short-lived pullback. The stock remains below its inception value (-10.6% total), but its positive weekly reversal signals renewed strength in high-beta AI software.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Royal Caribbean posted a moderate gain of +5.1%</strong> but remains the portfolio’s biggest laggard at -13.49% since inception. While the recent move is encouraging, the position remains under monitoring for potential rebalancing if weakness persists.
  </p>

  <!-- THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATION -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>The portfolio posted a strong +7.08% weekly gain</strong>, sharply reversing last week’s decline and restoring positive total returns.</li>
    <li><strong>No positions breached risk thresholds</strong>, including sector caps and single-position loss triggers.</li>
    <li><strong>Benchmark behavior remains supportive</strong>, with both the S&P 500 and Bitcoin rising, though neither matched the AI portfolio’s rebound.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum across storage, gold miners, and defensive names continues to validate current allocations</strong>, reducing the need for rebalancing.</li>
    <li><strong>The lag in RCL remains the only watchpoint</strong>, but stabilization this week removes urgency to adjust.</li>
    <li><strong>Holding allows the model to capture ongoing momentum</strong> while gathering additional data before considering rotation.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- VERDICT -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week supports a firm HOLD decision</strong>. The portfolio recovered strongly, regained benchmark leadership, and maintained internal balance across themes and sectors. Nothing in the data suggests a need to interrupt the current trajectory.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Potential changes next week would depend on</strong> renewed weakness in the bottom performers or unnatural concentration buildup in storage names should the rally accelerate further.
