  <p class="text-xl text-gray-300 mb-6">This week, the GenAi Chosen portfolio surged 7.08%, lifting total returns to 3.86% since inception, while the S&amp;P 500 gained 2.57% on the week and now stands up 1.86% overall, and Bitcoin added 4.37% this week but remains deeply negative at -25.85% since inception.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Portfolio Progress November 20 – November 28, 2025</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio continues its mission</strong> as a concentrated, transformer-driven stock selection strategy seeking to outperform the S&amp;P 500 through high-upside, high‑momentum names. Built from an initial $10,000 allocation, the model optimizes exposure to sectors showing acceleration, resilience, or emerging leadership.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>This week delivered a sharp rebound</strong> as the portfolio jumped to $10,386, fully recovering last week's drawdown and extending its lead over the S&amp;P 500 on a total‑return basis. Despite turbulence earlier in November, the model has reasserted its momentum‑based edge.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Powered by strong rotations into tech hardware and commodities</strong>, the portfolio benefited from broad‑based upside across nearly every holding. The rebound illustrates how the AI allocation framework thrives in weeks where sector flows re‑align with underlying trend strength.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The portfolio currently holds the following ten stocks:</p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li>PLTR – Palantir Technologies</li>
    <li>NEM – Newmont Corp</li>
    <li>STX – Seagate Technology</li>
    <li>GEV – GE Vernova</li>
    <li>WDC – Western Digital</li>
    <li>GE – General Electric</li>
    <li>CVS – CVS Health</li>
    <li>NRG – NRG Energy</li>
    <li>HWM – Howmet Aerospace</li>
    <li>RCL – Royal Caribbean Cruises</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>No trades were executed this week</strong>, meaning the strong performance is entirely attributable to market movement rather than allocation changes. The static positioning allows us to clearly assess the momentum profile of each holding.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Hardware Momentum, Gold Strength, Palantir Recovery</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Hardware storage stocks led the charge</strong>, with STX up 13.18% and WDC up 12.47% as investors rotated aggressively into data‑infrastructure plays. This surge reinforces the AI model’s overweight in technology enablers rather than mega‑cap front‑end AI names.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Newmont surged 10.4%</strong> as gold‑linked equities caught a tailwind from shifting real‑rate expectations. This move validates the portfolio’s counter‑cyclical exposure, which acted as a stabilizing force during earlier tech softness.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Palantir rebounded 6.56%</strong> after weeks of consolidation, demonstrating renewed confidence in AI‑driven platforms. While still down -10.6% since inception, the weekly move shows buyers reclaiming control.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>RCL climbed 5.1%</strong> as travel sentiment improved despite macro uncertainty, hinting at underlying resilience in discretionary spending. Although it remains one of the laggards at -13.49% total return, the positive inflection is encouraging.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>Broader Industrials and Healthcare posted steady gains</strong>, with GE, CVS, NRG, and HWM each moving between 2% and 5%, contributing to the portfolio’s balanced recovery.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Performance Since Inception</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The chart below shows normalized performance for the portfolio, the S&amp;P 500, and Bitcoin, allowing apples‑to‑apples comparison regardless of starting price levels.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">All assets are normalized to 100 on the October 9, 2025 inception date, with 100 displayed as the central reference line. Readings above 100 indicate gains since inception; readings below 100 indicate losses.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">The GenAi Chosen portfolio sits comfortably above the 100 baseline, outpacing the S&amp;P 500’s modest improvement while Bitcoin remains sharply below 100, underscoring the relative strength of the AI‑managed strategy.</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Broad-based upside supports stability</strong>, with all ten holdings finishing positive on the week.</li>
    <li><strong>Total return now exceeds both benchmarks</strong>, reinforcing that the current structure is working effectively.</li>
    <li><strong>No risk triggers were activated</strong>, as no positions breached drawdown thresholds or concentration caps.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum remains aligned with portfolio bias</strong>, particularly in tech hardware and commodity-linked names.</li>
    <li><strong>Market internals still favor risk appetite</strong>, indicating no immediate need for defensive rebalancing.</li>
    <li><strong>Holding steady allows trend continuation</strong> while keeping the model ready to adapt should volatility return.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6"><strong>The call for this week is HOLD</strong>, as the portfolio’s recovery and benchmark outperformance signal that the existing allocation continues to add value. The combination of hardware momentum and commodity strength validates the AI system’s sector placements.</p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">A shift to SELL or REBALANCE would require renewed drawdowns, sector breakdowns, or a major relative‑strength reversal versus the S&amp;P 500—none of which are present this week.</p>
