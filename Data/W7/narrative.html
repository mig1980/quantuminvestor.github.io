    <strong>This week, the GenAi Chosen portfolio surged sharply higher</strong>, gaining +7.08% and lifting total returns since inception to +3.86%. Over the same Nov 20 – Nov 28 window, the S&P 500 advanced +2.57% to 6,812.61, while Bitcoin recovered +4.36% to $91,456 after last week’s deep drawdown. Despite broader market stabilization, the AI‑driven portfolio outpaced both benchmarks by a wide margin.

  <!-- PORTFOLIO PROGRESS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Portfolio Progress Nov 20 – Nov 28, 2025</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>The GenAi Chosen portfolio is a $10,000 aggressive stock strategy</strong> powered by a <strong>transformer‑based AI model</strong> designed to outperform the S&P 500 through high‑conviction momentum positioning. The framework intentionally tolerates volatility in pursuit of superior long‑term gains.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>My mandate is simple:</strong> Allocate $10,000 across 10 stocks with strong upside potential, accelerating momentum, and sector‑constrained risk exposure, seeking to beat the S&P 500 while maintaining disciplined position sizing.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week delivered a decisive rebound</strong> after last week’s pullback, with gains concentrated in data storage, gold miners, and travel. The portfolio’s recovery outpaced both major benchmarks, reaffirming the model’s capacity to capture momentum inflections.

  <!-- WEEKLY HIGHLIGHTS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Storage Surge, Gold Momentum, Travel Recovery</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Data‑storage names delivered the week’s standout performance</strong>, with Seagate (STX) up +13.18% and Western Digital (WDC) up +12.47%. This move aligns with accelerating demand in AI infrastructure spending and refreshed optimism across semiconductor‑adjacent hardware names.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Gold miner Newmont (NEM) added +10.4%</strong>, benefiting from a renewed bid in precious metals as investors hedged geopolitical uncertainty and shifting interest‑rate expectations. The position continues to serve as the portfolio’s defensive ballast.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Palantir (PLTR) posted a solid +6.56% gain</strong> after last week’s softness, signaling renewed institutional accumulation in high‑growth AI software. Despite remaining down since inception, PLTR’s improving trend strengthens the upside case.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Travel and leisure also rebounded</strong>, with Royal Caribbean (RCL) climbing +5.1%. Although the position remains deeply negative (-13.49% total return), this stabilization reduces near‑term portfolio drag.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Core industrial and defensive names added modest but steady gains</strong>, with GE, CVS, NRG, and HWM all advancing between +2% and +5%. These helped diversify the week’s upside beyond the high‑beta leaders.

  <!-- RECOMMENDATION -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>The portfolio rebounded strongly</strong>, rising +7.08% on the week and pushing total returns to +3.86%—a significant recovery that does not require tactical intervention.</li>
    <li><strong>No risk-trigger thresholds were hit</strong>, with no position exceeding size caps or incurring excessive drawdowns relative to rules-based constraints.</li>
    <li><strong>Benchmark conditions remain favorable</strong>, as both equities and crypto staged partial recoveries, reducing systemic volatility pressure.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum signals strengthened in key overweight categories</strong>, especially data storage and precious metals, supporting the current allocation.</li>
    <li><strong>The model’s diversification worked as intended</strong>, cushioning underperformance in laggards like RCL while amplifying gains in high‑conviction sectors.</li>
    <li><strong>A rebalance may be considered next week</strong> if STX or WDC continue to expand far beyond their target risk bands, but no action is warranted yet.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- VERDICT -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week supports a disciplined HOLD</strong>. The portfolio recovered sharply, regained positive territory since inception, and remains positioned according to the AI model’s long‑term outperformance mandate.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Looking ahead</strong>, the primary triggers for change would be extended overconcentration in storage names, further deterioration in RCL, or macro‑driven rotational shifts. For now, the strategy remains firmly on course.
