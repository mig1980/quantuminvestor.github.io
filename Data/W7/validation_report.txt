❌ **Prompt A Validation: FAIL**

Found 1 error in Week 7:

1. Inception Consistency:  
   Expected `meta.inception_value`, `portfolio_history[0].value`, and `normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value` to all match exactly.  
   Expected: 10000  
   Got:  
   • `meta.inception_value` = 10000  
   • `portfolio_history[0].value` = 10001  
   • `normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value` = 10001  

All other stock‑level metrics, portfolio totals, benchmark calculations, weekly/total percentages, array synchronization, and normalized chart values were validated and are correct within tolerance.  

Review automation script's initialization of portfolio_history and normalized_chart inception values.
