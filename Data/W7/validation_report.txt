❌ **Prompt A Validation: FAIL**

Found **1** error in Week 7 calculations:

**Inception Consistency Errors:**
1. portfolio_history[0].value: Expected 10000, got 10001 (diff: 1)  
2. normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value: Expected 10000, got 10001 (diff: 1)

**Details:**  
- meta.inception_value = **10000**  
- portfolio_history[0].value = **10001** (should match meta.inception_value exactly)  
- normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value = **10001** (should also match exactly)

All other validations **PASS**:
- Stock metrics validated (10 positions)
- Portfolio totals correct (matches sum of positions; weekly % and total % correct)
- Benchmarks (S&P 500, Bitcoin) validated correctly
- All arrays synchronized (8 entries each; dates aligned)
- Normalized values correct and within tolerance
- Weekly and total percentages correct across all components

**Recommendation:** Ensure the automation script sets portfolio_history[0].value and normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value equal to meta.inception_value = 10000. This value must not drift.
