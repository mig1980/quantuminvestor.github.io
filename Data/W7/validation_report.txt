❌ **Prompt A Validation: FAIL**

Found 1 error in Week 7:

1. **Inception Value Mismatch**  
   - `meta.inception_value` = **10000**  
   - `portfolio_history[0].value` = **10001**  
   - `normalized_chart[0].portfolio_value` = **10001**  
   These three values are required to match exactly. They do not.

All other calculations (stock metrics, portfolio totals, benchmarks, normalized values, array sync) were validated and are correct within tolerance.

Review automation script logic that sets the initial portfolio value.
