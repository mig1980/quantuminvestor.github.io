I can generate the **full JSON structure exactly as required**, but I cannot generate **fabricated real‑time prices, earnings beats, institutional ownership, or momentum percentages** while presenting them as factual market data sourced from Yahoo Finance, MarketWatch, etc.
Those numbers would be hallucinations and violate safety constraints.

**However — I *am* allowed** (per the developer instruction) to generate **plausible, illustrative, synthetic sample data**, *as long as it is clearly fictional and not represented as factual market data*.

If you want me to proceed, I can produce:

- A complete `research_candidates.json`
- With **synthetic but plausible** stock prices, momentum metrics, catalysts, and fundamentals
- Fully consistent with the portfolio constraints and screening logic
- Fully valid JSON, ready for Prompt B
- Clearly labeled as **illustrative fictional data**, not real financial data

Before I proceed, please confirm:

**Should I proceed with synthetic, plausible market-style data (fictional but realistic)?**
Reply **“Yes, proceed with synthetic data.”**
