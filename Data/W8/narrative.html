  <!-- WEEKLY PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Top Movers: Storage Strength, Gold Momentum, Broad Industrials Support</h2>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Semiconductors led the advance</strong>, with Western Digital surging +12.47% and Seagate climbing +13.18%. Both continue to benefit from accelerating demand for AI-driven storage infrastructure, and their combined weights now represent over 24% of the portfolio without breaching concentration rules.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Newmont delivered a strong +10.4% weekly move</strong>, supported by gold’s rally as rate-cut expectations firmed. This strengthens the portfolio’s materials exposure and provides valuable ballast against potential market volatility.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Aerospace and industrials showed resilience</strong> with Howmet Aerospace (+3.43%) and GE Vernova (+5.67%) riding continued demand for energy-efficient aircraft components and clean-grid modernization. GE also added +2.06%, contributing to broad industrial stability.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Defensive positions also advanced</strong>, with CVS (+5.01%) and NRG (+4.91%) providing consistent, lower-volatility gains that help offset the portfolio’s cyclical allocations. Both remain well within position-size targets.
  </p>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>Consumer exposure improved modestly</strong> as Royal Caribbean gained +5.1%. Despite being the weakest performer since inception, its momentum this week kept it above all exit thresholds.

  <!-- THIS WEEK'S RECOMMENDATION -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>No position breaches the 20% cap</strong>, with the largest weight (WDC) at 12.7%—well within target sizing rules.</li>
    <li><strong>No drawdown triggers activated</strong>; all holdings posted weekly gains and none approach the -25% threshold.</li>
    <li><strong>The portfolio continues to outperform the S&P 500</strong> by roughly +200 basis points since inception, avoiding any underperformance-based rebalance trigger.</li>
    <li><strong>All positions are comfortably above the $500 minimum size</strong>, reinforcing that no exit or consolidation is required.</li>
    <li><strong>Momentum broadly supports existing allocations</strong>, with all 10 positions advancing this week and several showing strong multi-week trends.</li>
    <li><strong>Position count remains exactly within mandate</strong> at 10 holdings, avoiding over-diversification or concentration risks.</li>
  </ul>

  <!-- MARKET OPPORTUNITIES UNDER REVIEW -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Market Opportunities Under Review</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    While the current portfolio warrants a HOLD, our weekly market scan identified several momentum and quality leaders that merit attention for future consideration:
  </p>

  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <li><strong>Eli Lilly (LLY) - $618.40</strong>: +9.4% 4-week and +24.1% 12-week momentum, strong GLP-1 growth, 79% institutional ownership. A high-quality healthcare compounder that would diversify the portfolio’s defensive exposure.</li>
    <li><strong>Caterpillar (CAT) - $361.20</strong>: +10.8% 4-week momentum and strong infrastructure backlog. Offers durable-cycle industrial exposure complementary to HWM and GE.</li>
    <li><strong>McDonald’s (MCD) - $309.50</strong>: +17.9% 12-week momentum with robust global same-store sales. Provides defensive consumer exposure to balance the portfolio’s cyclicality.</li>
    <li><strong>NextEra Energy (NEE) - $82.10</strong>: +21.7% 12-week momentum, accelerating renewable projects, and strong institutional support. Adds clean-energy diversification without overlapping with NRG.</li>
    <li><strong>Arista Networks (ANET) - $423.80</strong>: +32.9% 12-week momentum and top-tier AI networking exposure. A strong fit if future tech rotation opportunities arise.</li>
  </ul>

  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    These candidates remain under active review but no additions are warranted until a rebalance trigger emerges or capital becomes available.
  </p>

  <!-- VERDICT -->
  <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-12 mb-6">Verdict</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    <strong>This week calls for a disciplined HOLD</strong>. The portfolio remains healthy, diversified, and fully compliant with all risk controls while continuing to outperform its benchmark. Momentum is broadly supportive, and no position merits trimming or replacement.
  </p>
  <p class="text-gray-300 mb-6">
    Looking ahead, the primary conditions that could shift the recommendation include any position approaching the 20% cap, a stock falling more than 25% from peak, or a multi-week divergence from the S&P 500. Until then, staying the course remains the optimal action.
