<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  Welcome back to this week's performance review of the <strong>GenAi Chosen</strong> portfolio—a $10,000 aggressive stock portfolio managed by a
  <strong>transformer-based AI model</strong> and designed to outperform the S&amp;P 500 through momentum-driven, high-conviction equity selection.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  <strong>My goal:</strong> Deploy $10,000, spread across 10 stocks with the highest upside, strong momentum, and a clear tolerance for volatility, to beat the S&amp;P 500 over time.
</p>
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  Let's dive into the details.
</p>

<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  The GenAi Chosen portfolio currently holds the following stocks:
</p>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 text-gray-300 mb-6" aria-label="Current portfolio holdings">

          <li>Newmont Corp (NEM)</li>
          <li>Seagate Technology (STX)</li>
          <li>GE Vernova (GEV)</li>

</ul>

<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  On a weekly basis, <strong>Newmont Corp (NEM)</strong> led the portfolio with a gain of approximately +8.72%, 
  followed by Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) at about +4.67%. 
  On the downside, <strong>Seagate Technology (STX)</strong> fell roughly -5.72%, 
  while Western Digital (WDC) declined by around -3.94%. 
  In total return terms since each position's entry, <strong>Western Digital (WDC)</strong> remains the standout winner, 
  while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) is still the largest laggard, though within defined risk bands.

  to continue tracking medium-term momentum and relative strength without introducing additional transaction costs.
</p>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">This Week's Recommendation: HOLD</h2>
<ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-3 text-gray-300 mb-6" aria-label="Weekly performance analysis points">
  <li>
    <strong>Portfolio holds its lead despite a soft week:</strong>
    The GenAi Chosen portfolio slipped a modest -0.07%, yet total performance since inception remains ahead of the S&amp;P 500 
    (+3.88% vs. roughly +0.74%). This is exactly the profile you would expect from an aggressive, stock-driven strategy—higher volatility, 
    but a meaningful performance edge over time.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Newmont and RCL show constructive rebounds:</strong>
    Newmont Corp (NEM) posted the strongest weekly gain at about +8.72%, 
    while Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) advanced around +4.67%. 
    Both moves suggest renewed interest in gold miners and select travel names after prior underperformance.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Top winners remain in control of the narrative:</strong>
    Western Digital (WDC) continues to lead the portfolio in total return terms, up roughly +31.28% since inception. 
    This validates the momentum tilt of the GenAi process and highlights how a few strong winners can drive overall results.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Laggards are notable but not yet dangerous:</strong>
    While Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) remains the biggest drag in total return terms, its position size is constrained within risk parameters, 
    and no single holding approaches the 20% concentration cap. The drawdowns are uncomfortable but still within the tolerance band for an aggressive strategy.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Macro backdrop remains choppy:</strong>
    Broad equities continue to trade in a tight range, with the S&amp;P 500 up just +0.26% this week and less than +0.74% since our inception date. 
    Bitcoin, by contrast, is now down more than -19.17% over the same window, underscoring how the GenAi Chosen portfolio has delivered better risk-adjusted 
    exposure than simply chasing crypto volatility.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Risk triggers remain unbreached:</strong>
    There is no evidence of multi-week underperformance versus the S&amp;P 500, no single-stock weight above 20%, and no sector overweight breaching the 40% limit. 
    In other words, the risk framework is doing its job, and the AI’s high-conviction picks are still behaving within expectations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Verdict</h2>
<p class="text-gray-300 mb-4">
  <strong>HOLD</strong>. The data continues to support staying the course: the portfolio maintains a performance edge over the S&amp;P 500, 
  the biggest winners are still pulling their weight, and the weakest names remain within pre-defined risk limits. 
  Unless we see a sustained streak of underperformance versus the index or a clear breakdown in individual positions, 
  the most rational move is to let the transformer-based AI model continue compounding its edge rather than overreacting to a single flat week.
