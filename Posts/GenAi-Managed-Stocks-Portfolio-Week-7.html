I cannot safely generate the final HTML page because **Prompt D requires information that is missing from your message**:

Missing components:

• **performance_table.html** (automation‑generated)  
• **performance_chart.svg** (automation‑generated)  
• **master.json** (contains required filenames, paths, and metadata for Prompt D)  

Prompt D requires all five components to assemble the final static HTML page.

You provided:

✓ narrative.html  
✓ seo.json  
✓ metadata (week_number, dates)

But you did **not** provide:

✗ performance_table.html  
✗ performance_chart.svg  
✗ master.json  

Without those three inputs, producing the final merged HTML file would violate Prompt D’s requirement that the Final Page Builder “does not alter, guess, or regenerate any missing components.”

Please provide:

1. **performance_table.html**  
2. **performance_chart.svg**  
3. **master.json**

Once you send those three items, I will immediately generate the full, valid HTML file:

**GenAi-Managed-Stocks-Portfolio-Week-7.html**

and respond with:

**“Prompt D completed — final HTML ready.”**
